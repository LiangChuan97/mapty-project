# Mapty project

Goal / Objective

The goal of Mapty is to create an interactive web application where users can log workouts (running or cycling) on a map, track their activity details, and store the data for later access. Itâ€™s a real-world example of combining geolocation data, map rendering, and data persistence in the browser.
